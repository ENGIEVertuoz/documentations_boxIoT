This update is a major linked to the update of Logitech which reactivates the XMMP. You will have to recreate the conf file and especially activate in the Harmony application the developer mode activating the XMMP
For information, this shift intervenes the same day as the Logitech patch. Just like the workaround of 21-12-2018 which allowed many people to be repaired since it worked for everyone who was under Debian stretch (better than nothing). We did not know when Logitech was going to release support for XMMP. But blow after blow there was a reaction.

# 2018-12-21

Emergency correction related to the major of Logitech (temporary to troubleshoot, remember to relaunch the dependencies)
